# Evaluation of the microphysical assumptions within GPM-DPR using ground-based observations of rain and snow

This repository is for the paper whose title is written above ^

The paper can be found here: (currently in review, no-link avail).

The algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) for version 06 of the GPM-DPR algorithm is found in the repository. This is archived here incase it becomes difficult to find on the GPM documentation site: https://pps.gsfc.nasa.gov/GPMprelimdocs.html

Most rainfall data can be found from NASA's GHRC: https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/ or DOE Data Discovey tool: https://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have difficulties finding these. They were much to large to host here on github. 

The snowfall data can be found here: https://github.com/dmoisseev/Snow-Retrievals-2014-2015
